# Bank Record
Lab for Python Dictionaries and Lists
You will be writing a simple, user-friendly database for storing a bank. This program uses a dictionary to keep track of each entry. The keys will be a **string** of the owner of the account, and the values will be a **list** of attributes for that entry. The list will have two elements, the first being an **integer** of that entry's amount of money, and the second element will be a **string** that represents a comment to go with that entry **in that order**! An example looks like this:

`"Joe" : [5000, "Created on January 1, 1998"]`

For simplicity, you can assume valid input for most of the functions.
